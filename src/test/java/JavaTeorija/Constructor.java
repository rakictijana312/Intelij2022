package JavaTeorija;

public class Constructor {
    /* Block of code similar like methods, we are using them to initialize instance variables.
    They are first function to be called then the object is created.
    Constructor:
    1) name must be same like class name
    2) does not have any return type
    3) may or may not have any parameters.

    CANT BE ABSTRACT, FINAL OR STATIC
    WE CAN OVERLOAD USING DIFFERENT TYPE OF PARAMETERS BUT WE CAN'T OVERRIDE

    Difference with method:
    1) name
    2) return type
    3) constructor is called automatically when the object is created, method is called explicitly.
    4) compiler by default is providing default constructor if there is no constructor but does not create any method
