    /*

Garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory and identifying which
objects are in use and which are not and deleting unused objects. Once an object is
created it uses some memory and the memory remains allocated until there are
references for the use of the object.When there are no references to an object, it is
assumed to be no longer needed. There is no explicit need to destroy an object as Java
handles the deallocation automatically by using the Garbage Collection process.
Garbage collection in Java happens automatically during the lifetime of the program.
