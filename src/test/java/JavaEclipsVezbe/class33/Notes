FileHandling:
FileHandling in java means reading and writing the data to the files.
Steps:
1) Find the path of the file
2) Create the objects of FileInputStream/FileOutputStream
3) Depending upon the file type we create the objects of Properties/XSSFWork
4) We read the data/write and close our file.
================================================
Exceptions are some kind of issues/errors that disrupts the normal flow of code
during runtime and other important lines of code are not executed due
to that issue.
