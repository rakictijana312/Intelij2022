Variables and arrays are not flexible to solve common life problems
to overcome this we have Collections framework but collection framework can't be used
with primitive types it only support object types
Wrapper Classes:
are object equivalent of primitive data types that can be used with collections framework
and have built-in methods to convert one datatype to other.
1)ArrayList:
1) insertion order is maintained
2) Arraylists can contain duplicate values
3) we can access the elements using indexes by using the get method
4) If we are using collections framework to access the data most of the time we
should be using arrayList because arraylists use arrays under teh hood the read access
is very fast with arrays
5) if we require to insert the data in front or in the middle of the arraylist then we should
not be using arraylist because when an item is inserted in-between or in the start all
the elements in the arraylist are shifted towards right(can be very very slow if data is huge)
6) Because the arraylists can modify its size at run time it can be problematic to
use loops to to perform the add and remove operation to over come this
we have Iterators in java
