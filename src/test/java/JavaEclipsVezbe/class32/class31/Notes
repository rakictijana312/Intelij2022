Collections Framework:
1) ArrayList
2) LinkedList
3) HashSet
4) LinkedHashSet
5) TreeSet
==================
ArrayList:
is a datastructures that stores the element based on index
    1) it can hold duplicate values
    2) It maintains the insertion order
    3) Dynamic in nature(can adjust the size at runtime)
    4) Underlying data structure are arrays
When to Use:
    1) when we are not sure about the size(Will be better if we have an idea of the size we will be dealing)
    2) Fast retrieval based on index
LinkedList:
    1) it can hold duplicate values
    2) It maintains the insertion order
    3) Dynamic in nature(can adjust the size at runtime)
    4) Underlying data structure are doubly linked list
When to use:
    1) when we are not sure about the size
    2) When we have to modify the data most of the time we should be using LinkedList
3) HashSet
    1) No Duplicates
    2) Allows null
    3) No Order
When to use:
    1) When we have to remove the duplicates from the data(we don't care about the order)
3) LinkedHashSet
        1) No Duplicates
        2) Allows null
        3) Order is maintained
    When to use:
        1) When we have to remove the duplicates from the data and we don't want to lose the order

3) TreeSet
        1) No Duplicates
        2) No Null values
        3) data is sorted in natural order
    When to use:
        1) When we have to remove the duplicates from the data and we don't want to lose the order
Maps:
Map is interface that helps us store the data in the form of key value pairs
