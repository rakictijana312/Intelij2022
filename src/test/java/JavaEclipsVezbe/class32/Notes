Map:
Map is a data structure(a way to store and manipulate data) that stores
the data in the form keys and values.
Keys and values must be objects
Index is just a way of accessing the data from your data structure
Maps can have any type of object as their indexes.
Keys cannot be duplicate
values can be duplicate
When to use maps:
    1) Fast search because underlying data structure is a hash function that stores the
    data in the form of nodes
    2) when we want the indexes other than natural indexes like integers

Types of maps:
1)HashMap(order is not maintained Fastest) not thread safe
2)LinkedHashmap(Order is maintained slower than hashmap)
3)Treemap( it always store the data in a sorted way)
4)HashTable similar to the hashmap it should be used when we have to write
multithreaded code because it is thread safe but it is slower than HashMap
