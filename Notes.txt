TDD approach in cucumber

recap - class 3
hooks - we define our pre-condition and post condition here with the tags @Before & @After
glue - checks all the step definition implementation of gherkin steps
dry run  - if it is set to true, no actual execution happens, quickly scan all the  files to check
steps are there
monochrome - makes console log more readable
tags - we control the flow of execution of our scenarios with the help of tags
background - we define repeated steps inside it for respective feature file
passing data from feature file scenario
